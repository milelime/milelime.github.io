# Advent of Code Day 5 - Javascript

## The Problem

We are given input that represents crates in stacks and instructions on how to
move them.

It resembles the following:

```txt
    [D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2
```

## My thought process for part 1

My logic was complicated and bloated and it let to this:

```javascript
{
  const inputReal = fs.readFileSync("./day-5-input.txt", "utf8");

  let stacks = [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []];
  let instructions = [];

  let lines = inputReal.split("\n");
  if (lines[lines.length - 1] === "") {
    lines.pop();
  }

  let count = 0;

  while (lines[count] != "") {
    let line = lines[count];
    for (let i = 0; i < line.length; i += 4) {
      if (line[i] != " ") {
        let stackIndex = i / 4;
        stacks[stackIndex].splice(0, 0, line.substring(i, i + 3));
      }
    }
    count += 1;
  }

  count += 1;

  while (count < lines.length) {
    let line = lines[count];
    line = line.split(" ");
    line = [Number(line[1]), Number(line[3]), Number(line[5])];
    instructions.splice(0, 0, line);
    count += 1;
  }

  for (i in instructions) {
    let instruction = instructions[i];
    let num = 0;
    let from = stacks[instruction[1] - 1];
    let to = stacks[instruction[2] - 1];
    if (instruction[0] > from.length) {
      num = from.length;
    } else {
      num = instruction[0];
    }
    for (let j = 0; j < num; j++) {
      let moving = from.pop();
      to.push(moving);
    }
  }

  let stackMessage = "";

  for (i in stacks) {
    stackMessage += stacks[i].pop();
  }

  console.log(stackMessage);
}
```

This worked for the test data but gave the wrong result, so I reconsidered my
approach.
