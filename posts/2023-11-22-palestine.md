# Palestine Must Be Free

While I did not intend to use this blog as a means to express personal views beyond software development and programming, I realized I wanted to consolidate the work I do on Substack and other mediums into one.

Israel's occupation of Gaza, the West Bank, and the Golan Heights is brutal and the recent developments clarify the Israeli position: it will ethnically cleanse and genocide the Palestinian occupants and repopulate the lands with settler colonists.

The U.S. government along with almost every major power in the world is funding this terror and thousands of people have died just in the last 6 weeks because of the imperial project.

For a prosperous world where we can pursue our passions, love, and peace, Palestine must be free. The people living in the occupied areas must be protected and should be fed, clothed, and homed along with the rest of the world.

In Greece and other poor European countries, the populations are at least slowly starved and deprived of autonomy via austerity, but in Palestine, they are simply murdered or displaced.

Please consider donating to the link clickable on the banner. Please consider learning more about the BDS movement and other anti-zionist movements that will save the lives of Palestinian people. When the bombing and rape and pillage and destruction of Palestine stops, we may take a step toward the union of humans and the ouster of this fascistic and bordered global capital structure.
