# Welcome to my blog

## What is this going to be about?

Mostly development. I want to document what I am doing to bolster my development
skills in my free time. It's important that I can see my own progress and that
potential employers can see that I am really dedicated time and effort to it.

## How often will I post?

At least once a week. No matter what I'm doing -- whether I quit a project after 40 minutes
or have been working on solutions to a problem for a week I want to document it.

## The First Project

I am currently working on Advent of Code in JS. This is because I want to come up with
basic solutions that I can then apply in other languages I want to learn.

The first main project will be the beautification and maintenance of this website.

Cheers.
